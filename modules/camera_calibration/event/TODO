1. landmarks are fixed. so we can use continuous time representation not frame to calculate RPE.
No time epsilon needed in spline.

2. EventFrame is used for initialization. Frame need a duration to accumulate.

3. How to filter out event? noise event? outliers? Duplicate?


# TODO: read rolling shutter camera paper; create front end process events with pattern;
# 1. corner detected (hoof transform); traditional calibration process to get an init guess
# 2. multi-spline (extend when detect un-smooth) optmization
# opt: a event's reprojection error w.r.t (circle center + radius), (time uncentery of event:10^-6 ~ 10^-3, a guassian distribution?, to be checked, will determine what?)



TODO:
1. do cluster to find point set for positive and negtive frame.
2. calculate convex hull, then do convex hull symetric score, find out circles


****
*There are circles only have measurements on one side, we should use the prior of pattern to fix that after most circle detected
so we shouldn't delete noise.

*next step, two choice:
1. calculate convex hull, find out candidate circles, then do pattern match, after that re-explore the raw measurements.

2. directly apply pattern prior to point clusters, match pattern
