# opengv2

An open-source generalize modeled SLAM library

## Feature

1. Generalized multi-sensor rigid-body frame model.
2. Multi-thread: tracker, viewer, map optimizer.
3. Euclidean Spline and SO3 Spline.
4. Implemented Camera Model: pinhole, ominidir.

## Demo

1. One Point Ransac [[1]](#1)
2. Reliable frame-to-frame motion estimation for vehicle-mounted surround-view camera systems [[2]](#2)
3. B-splines for Purely Vision-based Localization and Mapping on Non-holonomic Ground Vehicles [[3]](#3)
4. Dynamic Event Camera Calibration [[4]](#4)
